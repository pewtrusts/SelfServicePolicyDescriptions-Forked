- **Entra ID Registration Status**: Confirms that your computer is properly registered with Entra ID (formally Azure AD). 

- **OS Patch Compliance**: Verifies that your macOS version is up-to-date with the latest security patches. 

- **Microsoft Defender Installation**: Ensures that Microsoft Defender is installed on your device for protection against threats. 

- **FileVault Status**: Checks if FileVault disk encryption is enabled to secure your data against unauthorized access.
